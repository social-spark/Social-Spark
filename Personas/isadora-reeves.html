<h1>Persona - Isadora Reeves</h1>
<p>
    <strong>Technology:</strong><br>
    <strong>Devices:</strong>  HP laptop and Samsung 22 Android phone<br>
    <strong>Love/Hate:</strong> She loves technology and uses it daily.<br>
    <strong>Proficiency:</strong> Excellent proficiency with technology as she works with computer applications and websites.

<div>
    <p><strong>Attitudes and Needs:</strong><br>Isadora is interested in using PromptMe.net because she heard it gives users daily
        prompts to start the conversation. Her friend mentioned that all she had to do was select areas of interest and log in daily to see
        her personalized prompts. Her friend also said she could share her posts on different social media accounts like her Facebook and Instagram.
        Isadora hasn't found a social media site that offers this and is excited to use it. </p>
    <p><strong>Frustrations:</strong> <br>Isadora always wants to post and share on her social media accounts but is always at a loss for what to post and share.
        She sees what others post and it's the usual memes, reels, or drama. There isn't any intellectual stimulation or conversation starters. She wants to share
        bits about her life but does not want to feel like she's gloating for sharing her wins or depressed for sharing her dilemmas. She wants her friends and
        family to know she is doing well and maybe think of her feed as a place for new and exciting posts.</p>
    <p><strong>Goals:</strong> <br>Isadora would like to use PromptMe.net to find like-minded friends and to get some great content for her other social media accounts.</p>


    <hr>
    <p><strong> User Story:</strong> <br>As a typical user of social media accounts, I would like to have personalized prompts to aid me in my posts to start
        conversations with others or to just share things in common.</p>
