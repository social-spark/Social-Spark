    <h1>Use Case</h1>
    <p>User Isadora is a casual user of social media. She would like to be more active but finds it difficult to find topics that interest
        her to talk about. Her friend has suggested a social media website called PromptMe.net. Isadora created a new profile and has already
        posted her first prompt. She is interested in viewing the trending items and what others have posted.

    </p>

    <p><em>Precondition:</em> Isadora is logged in to her PromptMe.net profile.</p>
    <p><em>Postcondition:</em> She is interested in viewing what others have posted in the "trending" feed. It looks like there are 3 categories, "UNMHockey",
        "Sandia" and "Foodies". </p>
